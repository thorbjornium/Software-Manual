# Rust RegEx syntax

## Matching one character

    .             any character except new line (includes new line with s flag)
    [0-9]         any ASCII digit
    \d            digit (\p{Nd})
    \D            not digit
    \pX           Unicode character class identified by a one-letter name
    \p{Greek}     Unicode character class (general category or script)
    \PX           Negated Unicode character class identified by a one-letter name
    \P{Greek}     negated Unicode character class (general category or script)

## Character classes

    [xyz]         A character class matching either x, y or z (union).
    [^xyz]        A character class matching any character except x, y and z.
    [a-z]         A character class matching any character in range a-z.
    [[:alpha:]]   ASCII character class ([A-Za-z])
    [[:^alpha:]]  Negated ASCII character class ([^A-Za-z])
    [x[^xyz]]     Nested/grouping character class (matching any character except y and z)
    [a-y&&xyz]    Intersection (matching x or y)
    [0-9&&[^4]]   Subtraction using intersection and negation (matching 0-9 except 4)
    [0-9--4]      Direct subtraction (matching 0-9 except 4)
    [a-g~~b-h]    Symmetric difference (matching `a` and `h` only)
    [\[\]]        Escaping in character classes (matching [ or ])
    [a&&b]        An empty character class matching nothing

Any named character class may appear inside a bracketed `[...]` character class. For example, `[\p{Greek}[:digit:]]` matches any ASCII digit or any codepoint in the `Greek` script. `[\p{Greek}&&\pL]` matches Greek letters.

Precedence in character classes, from most binding to least:

1. Ranges: `[a-cd]` == `[[a-c]d]`
2. Union: `[ab&&bc]` == `[[ab]&&[bc]]`
3. Intersection, difference, symmetric difference. All three have equivalent precedence, and are evaluated in left-to-right order.
        For example, `[\pL--\p{Greek}&&\p{Uppercase}]` == `[[\pL--\p{Greek}]&&\p{Uppercase}]`.
4. Negation: `[^a-z&&b]` == `[^[a-z&&b]]`.

## Composites

    xy concatenation (x followed by y)
    x|y alternation (x or y, prefer x) 

This example shows how an alternation works, and what it means to prefer a branch in the alternation over subsequent branches.

```Rust,noplayground
use regex::Regex;

let haystack = "samwise";
// If 'samwise' comes first in our alternation, then it is
// preferred as a match, even if the regex engine could
// technically detect that 'sam' led to a match earlier.
let re = Regex::new(r"samwise|sam").unwrap();
assert_eq!("samwise", re.find(haystack).unwrap().as_str());
// But if 'sam' comes first, then it will match instead.
// In this case, it is impossible for 'samwise' to match
// because 'sam' is a prefix of it.
let re = Regex::new(r"sam|samwise").unwrap();
assert_eq!("sam", re.find(haystack).unwrap().as_str());
```

## Repetitions

    x*zero or more of x (greedy)
    x+        one or more of x (greedy)
    x?        zero or one of x (greedy)
    x*?       zero or more of x (ungreedy/lazy)
    x+?       one or more of x (ungreedy/lazy)
    x??       zero or one of x (ungreedy/lazy)
    x{n,m}    at least n x and at most m x (greedy)
    x{n,}     at least n x (greedy)
    x{n}      exactly n x
    x{n,m}?   at least n x and at most m x (ungreedy/lazy)
    x{n,}?    at least n x (ungreedy/lazy)
    x{n}?     exactly n x

## Empty matches

    ^               the beginning of a haystack (or start-of-line with multi-line mode)
    $               the end of a haystack (or end-of-line with multi-line mode)
    \A              only the beginning of a haystack (even with multi-line mode enabled)
    \z              only the end of a haystack (even with multi-line mode enabled)
    \b              a Unicode word boundary (\w on one side and \W, \A, or \z on other)
    \B              not a Unicode word boundary
    \b{start}, \<   a Unicode start-of-word boundary (\W|\A on the left, \w on the right)
    \b{end}, \>     a Unicode end-of-word boundary (\w on the left, \W|\z on the right))
    \b{start-half}  half of a Unicode start-of-word boundary (\W|\A on the left)
    \b{end-half}    half of a Unicode end-of-word boundary (\W|\z on the right)

The empty regex is valid and matches the empty string. For example, the empty regex matches `abc` at positions `0`, `1`, `2` and `3`. When using the top-level [`Regex`](https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/struct.Regex.html "struct regex::Regex") on `&str` haystacks, an empty match that splits a codepoint is guaranteed to never be returned. However, such matches are permitted when using a [`bytes::Regex`](https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/bytes/struct.Regex.html "struct regex::bytes::Regex"). For example:

    ^               the beginning of a haystack (or start-of-line with multi-line mode)
    $               the end of a haystack (or end-of-line with multi-line mode)
    \A              only the beginning of a haystack (even with multi-line mode enabled)
    \z              only the end of a haystack (even with multi-line mode enabled)
    \b              a Unicode word boundary (\w on one side and \W, \A, or \z on other)
    \B              not a Unicode word boundary
    \b{start}, \<   a Unicode start-of-word boundary (\W|\A on the left, \w on the right)
    \b{end}, \>     a Unicode end-of-word boundary (\w on the left, \W|\z on the right))
    \b{start-half}  half of a Unicode start-of-word boundary (\W|\A on the left)
    \b{end-half}    half of a Unicode end-of-word boundary (\W|\z on the right)

Note that an empty regex is distinct from a regex that can never match. For example, the regex `[a&&b]` is a character class that represents the intersection of `a` and `b`. That intersection is empty, which means the character class is empty. Since nothing is in the empty set, `[a&&b]` matches nothing, not even the empty string.

## Grouping and flags

    (exp)          numbered capture group (indexed by opening parenthesis)
    (?P<name>exp)  named (also numbered) capture group (names must be alpha-numeric)
    (?<name>exp)   named (also numbered) capture group (names must be alpha-numeric)
    (?:exp)        non-capturing group
    (?flags)       set flags within current group
    (?flags:exp)   set flags for exp (non-capturing)

Capture group names must be any sequence of alpha-numeric Unicode codepoints, in addition to `.`, `_`, `[` and `]`. Names must start with either an `_` or an alphabetic codepoint. Alphabetic codepoints correspond to the `Alphabetic` Unicode property, while numeric codepoints correspond to the union of the `Decimal_Number`, `Letter_Number` and `Other_Number` general categories.

Flags are each a single character. For example, `(?x)` sets the flag `x` and `(?-x)` clears the flag `x`. Multiple flags can be set or cleared at the same time: `(?xy)` sets both the `x` and `y` flags and `(?x-y)` sets the `x` flag and clears the `y` flag.

All flags are by default disabled unless stated otherwise. They are:

    i     case-insensitive: letters match both upper and lower case
    m     multi-line mode: ^ and $ match begin/end of line
    s     allow . to match \n
    R     enables CRLF mode: when multi-line mode is enabled, \r\n is used
    U     swap the meaning of x*and x*?
    u     Unicode support (enabled by default)
    x     verbose mode, ignores whitespace and allow line comments (starting with `#`)

Note that in verbose mode, whitespace is ignored everywhere, including within character classes. To insert whitespace, use its escaped form or a hex literal. For example, `\` or `\x20` for an ASCII space.

Flags can be toggled within a pattern. Hereâ€™s an example that matches case-insensitively for the first part but case-sensitively for the second part:

```rust,noplayground
use regex::Regex;

let re = Regex::new(r"(?i)a+(?-i)b+").unwrap();
let m = re.find("AaAaAbbBBBb").unwrap();
assert_eq!(m.as_str(), "AaAaAbb");
```

Notice that the `a+` matches either `a` or `A`, but the `b+` only matches `b`.

Multi-line mode means `^` and `$` no longer match just at the beginning/end of the input, but also at the beginning/end of lines:

use regex::Regex;

```rust,noplayground
let re = Regex::new(r"(?m)^line \d+").unwrap();
let m = re.find("line one\nline 2\n").unwrap();
assert_eq!(m.as_str(), "line 2");
```

Note that `^` matches after new lines, even at the end of input:

```rust,noplayground
use regex::Regex;

let re = Regex::new(r"(?m)^").unwrap();
let m = re.find_iter("test\n").last().unwrap();
assert_eq!((m.start(), m.end()), (5, 5));
```

When both CRLF mode and multi-line mode are enabled, then `^` and `$` will match either `\r` and `\n`, but never in the middle of a `\r\n`:

```rust,noplayground
use regex::Regex;

let re = Regex::new(r"(?mR)^foo$").unwrap();
let m = re.find("\r\nfoo\r\n").unwrap();
assert_eq!(m.as_str(), "foo");
```

Unicode mode can also be selectively disabled, although only when the result *would not* match invalid UTF-8. One good example of this is using an ASCII word boundary instead of a Unicode word boundary, which might make some regex searches run faster:

```rust,noplayground
use regex::Regex;

let re = Regex::new(r"(?-u:\b).+(?-u:\b)").unwrap();
let m = re.find("$$abc$$").unwrap();
assert_eq!(m.as_str(), "abc");
```

## Escape sequences

Note that this includes all possible escape sequences, even ones that are documented elsewhere.

    \*              literal *, applies to all ASCII except [0-9A-Za-z<>]
    \a              bell (\x07)

    \r              carriage return
    \v              vertical tab (\x0B)
    \A              matches at the beginning of a haystack
    \z              matches at the end of a haystack
    \b              word boundary assertion
    \B              negated word boundary assertion
    \b{start}, \<   start-of-word boundary assertion
    \b{end}, \>     end-of-word boundary assertion
    \b{start-half}  half of a start-of-word boundary assertion
    \b{end-half}    half of a end-of-word boundary assertion
